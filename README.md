# Workshop Timer

This simple web app helps facilitate workshop sessions by providing preset timers for each exercise. Select an activity, optionally enter a custom duration, and start the countdown.

## Custom Duration

You can override the default timer length with your own value:

1. Enter the desired number of **minutes** in the input field next to the Start button.
2. Select an exercise or press **Start**.

If the input is empty or invalid, the app falls back to the preset time for the chosen exercise.
