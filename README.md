# Workshop Timer

This simple web app helps facilitate workshop sessions by providing preset timers for each exercise. Select an activity and start the countdown or override the time with a custom value.

## Custom Duration

You can override the default timer length with your own value:

1. Enter the desired number of **minutes** in the input field next to the Start button.
2. Select an exercise and press **Start**.

If the input is empty or invalid, the app falls back to the preset time for the chosen exercise.
Switching to another exercise always restores that exercise's preset duration so you don't lose the recommended timings.
